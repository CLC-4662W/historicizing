					<h2>Transparencies to PowerPoint</h2>
					<p>
						<p>People adopt technologies at different rates. There are early adopters who are enthusiastic about anything new. Then there are those who adopt the new technology as it becomes more mature, mainstream, and affordable. Finally, there are those who adopt because the old technology becomes obsolete. Christina Haas in her article "On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies" discusses some of the reasons people adopt or avoid new technologies. The transition from transparencies to HTML presentations occurred in two phases which illustrate this principle. The first phase was the development of PowerPoint. While there have not been any arguments for continuing to use the methods of making presentation media that existed before PowerPoint, there have been arguments both for and against using direct projection of slides from a computer using PowerPoint. The second phase of the transition was the develpment of frameworks for creating presentations using HTML. Again, there are arguments both for and against using PowerPoint instead of HTML. This presentation will describe these two phases and address how maturity of the technology and cost influenced how the technology matured and was adopted.</p>

						<h2>Early Presentations</h2>
						<p>In the 1870's, Jules Duboscq developed the overhead projector, then called a viewgraph (9). David E. Hansen patented the 35mm slide carousel in May of 1965 (3). Prior to PowerPoint, these were the instruments people used to show information in presentations. Overhead projectors use clear plastic transparencies as the media that contained the information. These are the size of an 8X10 inch piece of paper. The carousels used 35mm slides. Making these media for presentations was a tedious, costly and time-consuming process. The process required giving a sketch to a secretary, the secretary typing it, photocopying it, and finally giving it to the presenters for modifications, corrections, and comments.  This continued until the presenters were satisfied or until they actually had to give the presentation (6).</p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>At this time, presenters had little control over their presentations. To work around this problem, Robert Gaskins created a system that the presenters could use to make their own transparencies. His description of the system captures the exigence for a system to make overheads:</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					 <p><blockquote cite=Robert Gaskins, Sweating Bullets: Notes About Inventing PowerPoint, April 2012>This system was so cumbersome to use that it almost amounted to an unplanned laboratory experiment in how painful you could make a presentation system and still have the lab animals clamor to use it.
		</blockquote></p>

					<h2>PowerPoint</h2>
					<p>Robert Gaskins wrote his first concept of PowerPoint in 1984 (6). He and his team never envisioned PowerPoint replacing transparencies and 35mm slides. Rather, they designed PowerPoint to fulfill the desire on the part of the presenters to make their own slides, notes, and handouts. Gaskins observed in a worldwide tour that the style of presentations was universal. Based on this observation, he counted the slides with a particular design and used this information to design the slide templates that are available in PowerPoint. The first version of PowerPoint was for the Macintosh because its graphical interface was much more mature than Windows (1). PowerPoint took full advantage of all that the computer and its accessories offered. By today's standards, they did not offer much, but being able to design and create their own presentations was still a tremendous advantage to presenters. The technology for projecting directly from a computer to a screen did not exist yet, so the output from PowerPoint was shaped by the technology that was available. Only black and white (or green) monitors and printers were available, so PowerPoint 1.0 produced black and white slides that could be printed on black and white printers. The second version of PowerPoint offered color because monitors were now capable of it. This gave presenters the option to make color 35mm slides. The third version of PowerPoint was capable of video content, and the presentation could now be projected using laptops and video projectors.

					<h2>Different Rates of Adoption</h2>
					<p>Even when technology to project directly from PowerPoint existed, not everyone adopted it with wholehearted enthusiasm. Cost was probably one reason for this. Now, laptops and PowerPoint are inexpensive enough that nearly everyone can afford them, but at the time the technology became available, much of the hardware and software required was still too expensive for individual use. Also, the money required to install video projectors in every conference room may have been prohibitive for some institutions. However, as the technology has matured and become less expensive, so few conference rooms continue to have overhead projectors. There are certainly advantages to PowerPoint. Having all the slides correctly ordered in PowerPoint on a laptop is one because transparencies can be easily lost or mixed up in use and transport. However, from a teacher/student standpoint, transparencies have their advantages. For one, they slow the presentation which could be an advantage to students. It is also possible to write on and erase a transparency so they can be reused and written on in real time. This can be an advantage if the screen blocks the whiteboard. It's difficult to find overhead projectors now, but if there are still arguments for their superiority, this is an argument against a direct replacement model.

					<h2>Some Criticism</h2>
					<p>Now that PowerPoint is deeply ingrained in our culture, there has been some criticism of its use. Some of these criticisms have been put forward by Edward Tufte (12). He discusses how PowerPoint limits the amount of data that can be included on a PowerPoint slide. He believes this limits a user’s ability to do rigorous analysis and give intelligent technical presentations.
					</p>
				</section>

			
				<section>
					<h2>In Defense of PowerPoint</h2>
					<p>The Neilsen/Norman group wrote an excellent essay refuting Tufte's points(8). They do not believe that PowerPoint is to blame. Rather, the speaking and design skills of the presenter are weak. Tufte would argue that this is a result of the limitations inherent in the slide templates, and there may be truth to this statement. However, the design of the templates was based on presentations Robert Gaskins observed in his international tour. He took this tour at a time before PowerPoint, and given the amount of effort involved in creating these slides, the presenters would probably not have used such layouts if they were not effective. Perhaps those who have information should put more consideration into whether the best means to convey it is in a presentation or in a written report.</p>

					<h1>Alternatives to PowerPoint</h1>
					<p></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Free Offline Alternatives</h2>
					<p>People seek alternatives to PowerPoint for a variety of reasons. Seeking alternatives can be related to cost, a need for online collaboration, or just a desire not to contribute to the Microsoft monopoly. For reasons of cost and a desire not to use Microsoft products, there are offline alternatives - Impress in the LibreOffice suite is one (9). Impress in Apache's OpenOffice is another. These two are based on the same source code, but LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice. LibreOffice is getting more developer attention, so it has more new features. However, OpenOffice has better compatibility with Microsoft's products. These options have the advantage that they are free, and they offer many of the same features as PowerPoint.</p>
