        <h1>From Transparencies to HTML</h1>
        <p>The transition from transparencies to HTML presentations occurred in two phases. The first phase was the development of PowerPoint. While there have not been any arguments for going back to the methods of making presentation media that existed before PowerPoint, there have been arguments both for and against using direct projection of slides from a computer using PowerPoint. The second phase was the develpment of frameworks for creating HTML presentations. Again there are arguments both for and against using PowerPoint instead of HTML. Since each step in the transition still has adherents to the "old" way, the transition of the use of HTML as a presentation media is consistent with Haas's argument that changes in technology do not occur in a manner of simple replacement.</p>

          <h2>Transparencies</h2>
          <p>In the 1870's, Jules Duboscq developed the overhead projector, then called a viewgraph. David E. Hansen patented the 35mm slide carousel in May of 1965. Prior to PowerPoint these were the instruments people used show information in presentations. Overhead projectors use clear transparencies as the media that contained the information. These were the size of an 8X10 in. piece of paper. The carousels used 35mm slides. Making these media for presentations was a tedious, costly and time-consuming process. The process required giving a sketch to a secretary, the secretary typing it, photocopying it, and finally giving it to the presenters for modifications, corrections, and comments.  This continued until the presenters were satisfied or until they actually had to give the presentation. Robert Gaskins created a system that the presenters could use to make their own transparencies. His description of the system illustrates the desire for a system for making overheads:
		 </p>
		 <p> <blockquote cite=Robert Gaskins, Sweating Bullets: Notes About Inventing PowerPoint, April 2012>This system was so cumbersome to use that it almost amounted to an unplanned laboratory experiment in how painful you could make a presentation system and still have the lab animals clamor to use it.
		</blockquote></p>

		<p>The development of PowerPoint occurred largely within the company where its designers worked - Forethought. Because it was a proprietary environment, and the developers agreed on what they were trying to do, there was little argument and controversy in this process - at least as the participants remembered and recounted it.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>PowerPoint</h2>
          <p>Robert Gaskins wrote up his first concept of PowerPoint in 1984. He and his team never envisioned PowerPoint replacing transparencies and 35mm slides. Rather, they designed PowerPoint to fulfill the desire on the part of the presenters to make their own slides, notes, and handouts. Gaskins learned in a worldwide tour that the style of presentations was universal, and he counted the slides with a particular design. This information formed the templates that are available in PowerPoint. The first version of PowerPoint was for the Macintosh because its graphical interface was much more mature than Windows. It took full advantage of all that the computer and its accessories offered. The technology for projecting directly from a computer to a screen did not exist yet, so the output from PowerPoint was shaped by the technology that was available. For PowerPoint 1.0 only black and white (or green) monitors and printers were available, so PowerPoint produced black and white slides that could be printed on black and white printers. The second version of PowerPoint offered color because monitors were now capable of it. This gave presenters the option to make color 35mm slides. The third version of PowerPoint was capable of video content, and the content could now be projected using laptops and video projectors.

         <p>As with any new technology, not everyone adopted it with wholehearted enthusiasm. The reasons for this have had more to do with budgets and the money required to install video projectors in conference, but writings outlining the benefits of overhead projectors do exist. Having all the slides correctly ordered in PowerPoint on a laptop was certainly an advantage to transparencies which can be easily lost or mixed up in use and transport. However, from a teacher/student standpoint, transparencies have their advantages. For one, they slow the presentation which could be an advantage to students. It's also possible to write on and erase a transparency. This can be an advantage if the screen blocks the whiteboard. It's difficult to find overhead projectors now, but if there are still arguments for their superiority, this is an argument against a direct replacement model. 
		 </p>
		 <p>Now that PowerPoint is so deeply ingrained in our culture (add numbers here) there has been some criticism of its use. Some of these criticisms have been put forward by Edward Tufte. He discusses how PowerPoint limits the amount of data that can be included on a PowerPoint slide. This limits a user’s ability to do rigorous analysis and give intelligent technical presentations. 
		 </p>
		 <p> Several others have written excellent essays supporting PowerPoint and refuting Tufte's criticisms. One of these is from the Neilsen/Norman group. The article points out that PowerPoint is not to blame. Rather, the design of the slides by the presenter was not good. There is truth to this statement, but the design of the templates was based on presentations Robert Gaskins observed in his international tour. This was at a time before PowerPoint, and given the amount of effort involved, the presenters would not have used such layouts if they were not effective. Perhaps those who have information should put some consideration into the whether the best means to convey it is in a presentation or in a written report.

          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>HTML is the language that creates all the pages on the internet. Using HTML it is possible to create alternatives to Powerpoint. People seek alternatives to PowerPoint for a variety of reasons. Seeking alternatives can be related to cost, a need for online collaboration, or just a desire not to contribute to the Microsoft monopoly. For reasons of cost and a desire not to use Microsoft products there is at least one offline alternative - Impress in the LibreOffice suite. This option has the advantage that it is free and it offers many of the same features as PowerPoint. Documents from this office suite are saved in the OpenDocument format which is based on XML.</p>
		  <p> For those who want online collaboration or web-based access to their presentations at all times, there are many online frameworks for web-based presentations. These include Reveal.js, Fathom.js, and Impress.js and can be found in a search for PowerPoint alternatives. There are also simple and complex frameworks for creating slides using HTML. One simple one: <a href="http://www.faughnan.com/slides/readme.html">JavaScript slides</a>. More complex ones are created by Reveal.js and Impress.js. Impress.js is particularly interesting – the slides seem to be scattered on one large canvas and using the arrow keys allows navigation between the slides. One of the comments about Reveal.js illustrates Haas's assertion that technology evolution is not a linear direct replacement model. One reviewer claimed that an advantage of Reveal.js is that it does not use a WYSIWYG interface. This kind of interface was one of the essential features of the original PowerPoint. For many, possibly most, users of PowerPoint this would not be considered an advantage. This could be considered an example of cussedness making people not want to embrace change.</p>
		  <p>If the pre-made frameworks are not suitable for a particular purpose, there are also tutorials for creating custom <a href=" http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-presentation-slides-with-html-and-css--net-19870#disqus_thread">HTML slides</a>. A comparison between the simple framework created in 2001 and the tutorial created in 2011, shows an increase in complexity. This increase in complexity illustrates one way technology moves forward and gives users more options. One thing that Haas does not seem to consider in her writings is that there may be legitimate reasons for not embracing a particular technology at a given time. One reason for not using Bunkr (another HTML framework) given in the comments follwing a review was that it was not compatible with disability software, while PowerPoint is.  </p>
